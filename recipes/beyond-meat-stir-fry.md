* `2` thawed Beyond Burger patties

> Crumble the beyond burger into chunks roughly 1 inch squared.

>>> If you, like me, forgot to thaw your Beyond Burger patties, do not fret! Since we're crumbling the patties and don't have to worry about structure, it isn't too hard to thaw them in a satisfactory manner. Simply microwave for around a minute, poke holes through the patty spaced ~1 inch apart, and then continue microwaving in 30 second increments until you see little or no frost. Make sure to pour off any liquid sweated out by the patties before proceeding.
