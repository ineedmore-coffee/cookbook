* `8` Small Portobello Mushroom Caps

> Clean the mushroom caps and wash them thoroughly. Cut each cap in half, then make perpendicular slices around 1/4" thick.

---

* `3 cloves` Garlic
* `1 inch` Ginger

> Peel and finely dice the ginger and the garlic

---

* `1-2 tbsp` Olive Oil

> In a large, flat cast iron pan, heat up oil until very hot, then add the diced ginger and garlic.
>
>>> It's very important that the pan is **cast iron**, as other types of pans may not hold up as well to being lit on fire

---

> Once ginger and garlic are aromatic, add cut-up mushrooms and sauté on medium-high heat for 10-15 minutes, until mushrooms are dark brown.
>
>>> Be careful not to let moisture build, as low moisture is necessary for a good flame later.

---

* `4.5 ounces` Dark Rum

> Temporarily remove the pan from heat and pour in the rum. Make sure the mushrooms form an even layer on the pan.
>
>>> Never add alcohol to a pan while it's on a live flame!
>
>>> Before starting the flambé process, it's a good idea to keep a pan lid on hand to smother flames if they don't naturally die out.

---

> Quickly bring the pan back to heat, then light the rum on fire with a match or lighter. The flame should die off in 10-20 seconds.

---

> Remove from heat and add salt and pepper to taste.

## Notes

---

> There are definitely a few improvements I want to try next time I make this recipe. For one, the diced garlic and ginger ended up feeling intrusive, I may go with paste or powder next time. I also felt that the portobello pieces I used were too large, so I may switch to shiitake mushrooms for their flavor and size, or just cut the portobellos thinner.
